#%% Required set up 
# this imports everything you might need and opens a full screen window
# when you are developing your script you might want to make a smaller window 
# so that you can still see your console 
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os, sys
from psychopy import visual, core, event, gui, logging

# open a white full screen window
win = visual.Window(fullscr=True, allowGUI=False, color='white', unit='height') 

# uncomment if you use a clock. Optional because we didn't cover timing this week, 
# but you can find examples in the tutorial code 
#trialClock = core.Clock()


#%% your loop here
# start by copying your one trial here, then identify what needs to be
# changed on every trial.  Likely your stimuli, but you might want to change a few things


# make a list or a pd.DataFrame that contains trial-specific info (stimulus, etc)
# e.g. stim = ['1.jpg','2.jpg','3.jpg']


# make your loop
for t in ... :
    
    # include your trial code in your loop but replace anything that should 
    # change on each trial with a variable that uses your iterater
    # e.g. thisStimName = stim[t]
    #      thisStim = visual.ImageStim(win, image=thisStimName ...)
    
    # if you're recording responses, be sure to store your responses in a list
    # or DataFrame which also uses your iterater!


#%% Required clean up
# this cell will make sure that your window displays for a while and then 
# closes properly
